- Vulnerability 1: SQL Injection in `search my friends` bar allows to login as admin [(link)](vuln1.md)

## Notes

- Each reported vulnerability should have a PoC (a script)
  - In case you cannot script it, detail it as much as possible
- Each PoC should receive as 1st argument the http address (and port) of the server.
- For the case of XSS, if you need to receive the result in an external server, that address (and port) should be provided as the 2nd argument.
- Your PoC should set up all the needed values. Your PoC in the end should have an `assert` that validates your claims.
