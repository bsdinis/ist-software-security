NOTE:
=======
This HTML code is vulnerable to DOM-based XSS.
It DOES contains a very simple code with an document.URL as a source and document.location.replace as a sink.
A tainted value (name) is passed to document.location.replace() as its first parameter,
with index 2, corresponding to a security-sensitive parameter.
