NOTE:
=======
This HTML code is vulnerable to DOM XSS.
It contains a simple code with an document.URL as a source and document.writeln as a sink.
The vulnerable function (presentText) is called by another function(firstFunc) which in turn originates 
from a call located at a SCRIPT segment in the body of the HTML.

<html>
<head>
<script>
function firstFunc(str) {
	presentText(str+" [appended text]");
}

function presentText(txt) {
	document.write(txt);
}
</script>
</head>
<body>
Hello world!
<br>
<script>
	var txt = document.URL;
	firstFunc(txt);
</script>
<br>
Goodbye.
